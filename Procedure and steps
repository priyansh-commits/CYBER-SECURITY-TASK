Hi, I am PRIYANSH
and here I'll let you know how i got the flag.
So, Firstly I searched for the website on which I can enhance and improve the QR code as given as the task.
And the website used is - https://merri.cx/qrazybox/
There after spending some hours and figuring out the QR code, I got the first website, which contained a riddle for me, byte-cybersec-ps.vercel.app
Later when i figured out the answer to the riddle - It was a text file - Robots.txt
Next the next website which gave the hint (that I am clsoe) 
https://byte-cybersec-ps.vercel.app/almost_there_hc8z6ov72i 
here as the stage to find original flag we chave to solve the code by using reverse analysis and to find the code which can give the original flag. (code is in another file)

So this is how, I got the flag for this - Flag{3xpl0itin1g_8oundar1es_w1th_8yte}
